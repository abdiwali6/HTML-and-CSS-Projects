# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
Welcome! This repository will contain all of my coding projects for the HTML and CSS course. 

Each folder or file will represent different exercises, assignments, or projects I complete throughout the course. 

I will use GitHub to track my progress, collaborate, and build a portfolio of my work.
